Air Qaulity Monitoring System


**Shinyei PPD42** (10 EUR): This sensor is chosen for its ability to measure PM2.5 and PM10 particles, which are important indicators of air pollution and can have detrimental effects on health. It provides valuable information about the concentration of these particles in the air.

**MQ-135** (4 EUR): The MQ-135 sensor is specifically optimized for the detection of Carbon Monoxide (CO). It is highly sensitive to CO and can also detect other gases such as Ammonia (NH3), Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Benzene (C6H6), Alcohol, Methane (CH4), Propane (C3H8), and Butane (C4H10). This makes it versatile for monitoring a range of harmful gases.

**MQ-2** (1 EUR): The MQ-2 sensor is cost-effective and ideal for detecting gases commonly found in kitchens, such as LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), Butane (C4H10), Propane (C3H8), Methane (CH4), Alcohol, Hydrogen (H2), and Smoke. It helps ensure safety by monitoring gas leakage and potential fire hazards.

**BMP280** (5 EUR): The BMP280 sensor is primarily used for measuring air pressure. It provides accurate atmospheric pressure readings, which can be useful for weather monitoring and altitude calculations.

**DHT11** (1 EUR): The DHT11 sensor is an affordable option for measuring temperature and humidity. It allows monitoring of indoor climate conditions, which can impact comfort and health.

**CCS811** (17 EUR): The CCS811 sensor is capable of measuring Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) simultaneously. It provides valuable insights into indoor air quality and can help identify potential sources of pollution.

**MQ131** (17 EUR): The MQ131 sensor specializes in detecting Ozone (O3). It provides an accurate measurement of Ozone levels, which is crucial for understanding air quality in environments where Ozone concentration can impact human health.
