Air Qaulity Monitoring System

## Key Features:
**Real-time Monitoring:** The system continuously monitors the air quality and provides real-time data on various parameters such as temperature, humidity, particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), VOCs, CO2 levels, and ozone concentration. This real-time monitoring allows for immediate detection and response to any changes or issues in the air quality.
**Wireless Connectivity:** The system incorporates wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi, enabling seamless communication between the monitoring devices and the mobile application or central server. This allows users to access the air quality data remotely and receive alerts or notifications on their smartphones or other devices.
**Mobile Application Integration:** The system integrates with a mobile application, which provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing and interacting with the air quality data. Users can access real-time measurements and historical data and set alerts through the mobile app.
**Alerts and Notifications:** The system can send automated alerts and notifications to users' mobile devices when the air quality exceeds certain thresholds or if any abnormal conditions are detected. This enables users to take immediate action or change to maintain a healthy environment.



**DHT11**: The DHT11 sensor is an affordable option for measuring temperature and humidity. It allows monitoring of indoor climate conditions, which can impact comfort and health.

**SDS011**:

**ENS160**: The ENS160 sensor is capable of measuring Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) simultaneously. It provides valuable insights into indoor air quality and can help identify potential sources of pollution.

**MQ131**: The MQ131 sensor specializes in detecting Ozone (O3). It provides an accurate measurement of Ozone levels, which is crucial for understanding air quality in environments where Ozone concentration can impact human health.
